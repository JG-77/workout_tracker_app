## Description

---

Introducing the Workout Tracker Application! With this app, keeping track of your fitness progress is made a breeze! Users are able to create new exercises and add them to their daily workout which will then aggrgate their daily activities to show a total workout duration for the day! The dashboard page
will display two graphs which show the daily workout duration in minutes and the total pounds used in the daily workout. If a user decides to create a new workout or continue a workout, the user will be able to classify the workout as either resistance or cardio, and will then enter the exercise information of that workout. Fitness progress is made more convenient and hassle free to monitor to allow you to better focus on your workout!
